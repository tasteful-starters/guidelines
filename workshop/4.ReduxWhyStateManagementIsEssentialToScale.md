# Redux: Why state management is essential to scale

- changes in state are made by events that are logged

    This makes it a loooot easier to debug

- All state changes are handled by reducers > much easier to read and work with state

Redux parts:

- Reducers

    Where the state is changed

- Actions

    To trigger Reducers and Effects

- Effects

    Everything Async (mostly server requests)
    When they've done their 'job(s)' they then call actions that trigger reducers
